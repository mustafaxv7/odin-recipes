    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
      <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened,
        10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms;
        add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. 
        Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat.
        Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
        Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
      </li>
